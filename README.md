# misc
A few weird and wonderful little utilities that I threw together while I was writing an ircbot

* countdown - a little utility for doing countdowns to events
* bq        - a little utility to run searches for quotes on brainyquotes.com
* react     - not sure if this has much use but it generates a regex from a json file and returns a random match from a string slice
